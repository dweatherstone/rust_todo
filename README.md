# WebbApp Tutorial

This is a tutorial to build a web app from the ground up using the rocket package.

The first part of the tutorial is found [here](https://betterprogramming.pub/how-to-write-a-web-app-in-rust-part-1-3047156660a7), and creates a web app of a to-do program that writes the list to a local file.

The second part of the tutorial introduces the use of databases, specifically using PostgreSQL, and can be found [here](https://betterprogramming.pub/how-to-write-a-web-app-in-rust-part-2-2da195369fc1).

The third part of the tutorial is [here](https://medium.com/better-programming/building-the-rust-web-app-how-to-use-object-relational-mapper-3af2084555b6), and adds Object Relational Mapping, and a docker container for the Postgres database, rather than setting it up locally.

The fourth part of the tutorial is [here](https://medium.com/better-programming/building-the-rust-web-app-proper-error-handling-and-return-values-723f1f07f8cd) and will look at error handling and return values.
